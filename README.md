# py-WOMBAT (1D)
## WOMBAT-lite biogeochemical model

This repository contains a **1D water column implementation** of the **WOMBAT-lite biogeochemical model**, adapted to run on the **Gadi supercomputer** at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), Australia.

The model is intended for use within a **Jupyter Notebook interface** on **Gadi’s Australian Research Environment (ARE)**, making it suitable for testing, development, and biogeochemical experimentation in a lightweight setting.

---

## 🧪 Model Overview

- **WOMBAT-lite** is a reduced-complexity ocean biogeochemical model, focusing on key oceanic biogeochemical processes.
- This 1D version simulates vertical dynamics (mixing, sinking, remineralisation) and biological activity in a single water column.
- Ideal for prototyping new parameterisations, testing trait-based formulations, or running sensitivity experiments.
- Tracers include:
  - Nitrate (no3) [mmolN/m3]
  - Dissolved Iron (dfe) [mmolFe/m3]
  - Phytoplankton carbon biomass (phy) [mmolC/m3]
  - Zooplankton carbon biomass (zoo) [mmolC/m3]
  - Detritus carbon biomass (det) [mmolC/m3]
  - Phytoplankton chlorophyll biomass (pchl) [mg/m3]
  - Phytoplankton iron biomass (phyfe) [mmolFe/m3]
  - Zooplankton iron biomass (zoofe) [mmolFe/m3]
  - Detritus iron biomass (detfe) [mmolFe/m3]

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Access to the [Gadi supercomputer](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Gadi+User+Guide)
- An active NCI project allocation to gb6, qv56 --> these are for access to the forcing files (e.g., surface temperature, etc.)
- Access to the [Australian Research Environment (ARE)](https://are.nci.org.au/)
- A Gadi-compatible environment with required Python dependencies (see below)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository on Gadi

Once on Gadi:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pearseb/py-WOMBAT.git
cd py-WOMBAT
git checkout pyWOMBAT-on-Gadi
```

I would recommend making a new experimental branch for yourself where developments and experiments can be run
```bash
git checkout -b my_new_branch
```

---

### 2. Create a custom conda environment called "pyWOMBAT_env"

```bash
module use /g/data/hh5/public/modules
module load conda/analysis3-unstable
```
Follow [these instructions](http://climate-cms.wikis.unsw.edu.au/Conda#Creating_personal_environments) to set up your conda workspace, particularly the .condarc file in your home directory. Make the ~/.condarc file using a text editor (e.g. emacs) in your home directory (copying text on linked nci site) and save it. If on Gadi dont worry about the commands starting ith 'Deactivate...'. Then switch into you \py-WOMBAT directory.  Once inside run
```bash
conda env create -f py-WOMBAT.yml
```
This will create an environment called **pyWOMBAT_env** that you will need to point to when you spin-up your jupyter notebook on the ARE (next step).

### 3. Spin-up an ARE Jupyter notebook

Go to the [Australian Research Environment (ARE)](https://are.nci.org.au/) and click on **JupyterLab**

Make sure you charge to the correct project code, that you have enough compute and that you have access to the right project datasets...\

Make sure that you click on **advanced settings** and point the notebook towards your custom conda environment...\

And launch!\

### 4. Running the Standard Model

To get started:

1. Open the notebook: **`run_standard.ipynb`**
2. Execute the code cells sequentially to run the basic 1D model.
3. You can experiment with changing:

   * **Year**
   * **Latitude**
   * **Longitude**
   * **Run length** (in days)

---

The **year**, **latitude**, and **longitude** determine the environmental conditions for the 1D water column simulation. The model automatically retrieves:

* **Surface temperature**
* **Wind speeds**
* **Downward shortwave radiation** (i.e., sunlight reaching the surface)
* **Mixed layer depth**
* **Vertical velocities**

For example:

> If you set the year to **2001** and the coordinates to **30°S, 200°E**, the model will extract data for that location in the **central south Pacific** for the year 2001.

---

The forcing datasets used include

* **Atmospheric forcing**: [JRA55-do](https://climate.mri-jma.go.jp/~yukimoto/jra55do/)
* **Oceanographic fields** (e.g. mixed layer depth and vertical velocities): [BRAN2020](https://research.csiro.au/bluelink/outputs/bran/)
